# github-finder
JavaScript application that finds Github user by username. It's part of Udemy course: Modern JavaScript From The Beginning.
It was a good way to learn about async and await in JS. That is a good way to work with promises.
Bad thing about this project is that client id and client secret are visible in browser. During that time I didn't know to do it differently.
